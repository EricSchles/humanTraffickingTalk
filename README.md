#Disclaimer:

The data in this project has explicit material.  This is because I am an anti-slavery researcher interested in erraticating the problem of slavery.  An unfortunate part of slavery is that it involves many different sub-markets including but not limited to sex trafficking and child sex trafficking.

This means the data I am trying to process is sometimes pictures of prostitutes since these are the people I am trying to help - specifically if they are being forced into prostitution against their will.

I have made a best effort to only process images of people over the age of 18.
