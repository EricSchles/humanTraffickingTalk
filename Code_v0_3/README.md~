python recursive_scrape.py
--does the scraping of all links


python results_filter_women.py
--filters women searching for men with pictures and without pictures

python results_filter_men.py

next within results/results_women you must create two folders:

prostitutes and non_prostitutes

Then you must manually sort the first 130 records into prostitutes 
and non_prostitutes.

next within results/results_men you must create two folders:

johns and non_johns

Then you must manually sort the first 130 records into johns and non_johns.  
This manual sorting only needs to be done once.

--classifies the remaining data into johns, non_johns and hard_to_classify

python classify_women.py
